<dd><p>Thanks David for taking the time to feed back your thoughts. As another of your readers said, there are images which leave (some) people scratching their heads - but that is probably a good thing as it means that a) they were actually arrested by them and b) they were intrigued enough to think about them and not dismiss them outright.<BR/><BR/>Clearly there are photos that we look at and at first see little more than what is physically in front of us. Then, slowly and probably sub-consciously, the image grows on us and we begin to see more.<BR/><BR/>The concrete slipway running into the sea may well be a photographer’s photograph but it is very accessible without the viewer knowing anything about photography. It conveys serenity, the colours are cool and calming; the way the slipway disappears gives me a feeling of infinity. Perhaps even timelessness, despite the concrete dating the image to modern times. <BR/><BR/>Perhaps I am way off your intentions, but never mind – I like the image a lot. Its wow factor is diametrically the opposite of so many others because of its limited colour range and its simplicity in composition. Indeed, I think that this is probably a very commercial image; I can see it successfully hanging either in the setting of a modern home or a commercial property. I can also see this as a very successful greeting card for certain occasions. Is this perhaps a third class of image: an artistic photograph which is accessible to Joe Bloggs as well as someone who has a more developed appreciation of art?</p>

<dd><p>Hi Adam<BR/><BR/>I guess I should have mentioned that a photographer's photograph should be considered not just from the viewer's p.o.v. but also from the standpoint of the maker. For me the concrete pier is a photographer's photograph because I can't imagine a non-photographer seeing the possibility of an image let alone making it. I'm not being big headed, I know many other photographers who might have made this image when presented with the possibility, but I think that one needs to have explored photography in reasonable depth before one could 'see' such an image. This is perhaps at the root of the highlighted separation between laymen and photographers. One often needs a certain level of experience before one can appreciate the 'photographer's photograph'. But not always! The best images could only have been seen by a photographer but can be appreciated by almost anyone.</p>

<dd><p>David, you are absolutely correct. It does indeed take a lot of experience but also a good "artistic eye" to spot the opportunity. I can think of two young ladies, neither of whom has the required number of years to match my photographic experience, but I have to admit that both are better than me. Enough from me, anybody else has something illuminating to offer?</p>

<dd><p>I know that in the context of this discussion I am very much one of the "laymen".<BR/><BR/>It was a big eye opener for me travelling in the USA with David and Niall Benvie as both of them saw, and made, excellent photographs where I thought none were to be had. My own photographs were very much of the "bleeding obvious" and I suspect that I sometimes missed even those!<BR/><BR/>I would very much like to believe that, if I spend enough time making photographs, and studying those made by others, my eye will become attuned to the subtler view. However I am reasonably sure that this is not the case and that good "photographic eyes" are born, not created by hard work.  I have after all been doing it for a long time already with precious little improvement!  That is not to say that you cannot improve your seeing with practice, you clearly can, and I have, its just that lots of practice doesn't necessarily make you a great photographer.<BR/><BR/>On the other hand perhaps I'm wrong and I'll peak in my late 90's.</p>

<dd><p>I have to disagree with both Adam and David. To me, a 'photographer's photograph' is one which puts showing off technique above making an artistic statement. <BR/><BR/>At the risk of further muddying the waters, I would like to introduce a third category and call David's example an '<I>artist's</I> photograph'. The emphasis here is on 'this is what I've seen, isn't it beautiful?', rather than, 'this is what I can do, isn't it cool?' <BR/><BR/>In the 'artist's photograph', the audience is invited to share something of the photographer's perception at the time the image was made whereas, to my mind, the maker of a 'photographer's photograph' merely hopes that the audience marvel at his skill.</p>

<dd><p>I have to agree with David Wh. as it's my certainly my own experience, too. A true artist not only understands his response to what he sees, but he also knows exactly how to communicate this response. My problem, and I suspect it is a problem shared by many of us, is not only connecting with our feelings in the first place but also having the mastery of technique to clearly express those feelings.<BR/><BR/>I suspect that, if our images tend towards the obvious, as I feel mine do, it is because we go looking for compositions from a purely intellectual standpoint without first really understanding exactly what it is we <I>feel emotionally</I> about a location and only then engaging the intellect in order to find a composition which expresses that emotion.</p>

<dd><p>Julian & David<BR/><BR/>I like the definition of artist's photograph as this fits pretty well with my approach to making images. I think that the ego of the photographer should be invisible in the image and I've long been an admirer of the quiet voice in photograph, as exemplarised by the work of Paul Wakefield and Pete Dombrowski. <BR/><BR/>Eddie is working on a book with Paul at the moment and a passing comment by him really struck a chord with me. He told Eddie that he couldn't remember the last time he'd shot in direct sunlight. Whilst I still do the frequency of my making images in direct light has dropped steadily over the years. I think that quiet light is part of making quiet images. Full blown warm light is too exclamatory, it often overwhelms the subject.<BR/><BR/>As to whether I 'know' what I feel and how to express it in a photograph I would say that if I do it is purely in a subconscious way. I don't plot or plan my image making but feel my way. I would disagree that photographers are born rather than made. If this were true I wouldn't have had to struggle for 25 years!</p>

<dd><p>Greetings to all, good to see David Wh taking an active part! I go away for a day and look how the conversation has grown! I too like Julian’s “artist’s photograph” definition, as it echoes my thinking - indeed perhaps what I am beginning to strive to achieve. I’ve had time to ponder this while sitting on a train under the English Channel and I think that the key is David’s (Ward) point in his post about Sami Nabeel’s book that we need to think *why* we are taking a picture.  But here I see a potential problem: if I am taking a picture simply because I like what I see, will that prevent me from making (as opposed to taking) a picture? Must I always feel some sort of emotion? <BR/><BR/>Possibly yes in order to create or make an image rather than just take. For example I very much enjoy close-up photography of flowers (and insects, though I have recently done little of this). Flowers in close up can be simply good portraits, or more-or-less botanical record shots, but can also have an artistic approach as for example with Sue Bishop’s work. However, I can’t think of any occasion where doing this sort of photography has made me *feel* anything special. Sure, there is the enjoyment of the (relatively easy) technical challenge and the pleasure of nature’s beauty up-close and in the details. What I see in macro does evoke some sense of wonder.<BR/><BR/>On the other hand, over the last 2-3 years I’ve been getting too close to trees for my own good. I have really got into the textures and colours of bark on very dull days, where the bluish and flat light has - I like to think - allowed me to see more than the layman. More so, I have been trying to create a subject, a composition, from what’s in front of me and have at times really struggled to find the subject which I felt was lurking there. I thought I could see and feel beauty but couldn't find it so to speak. But, seeing the slides I am pleased with some of the results and feel that yes, I did manage to achieve something after all. Actually, my recent tour to Perthshire as well as visits to my local woods has got me going on ferns too, but that’s for another topic!<BR/><BR/>The next challenge is to attack the wider vistas and put across the feelings I experience when faced with wonderful landscapes. For example those we saw on the trip which David Wh refers to. Incidentally David, you are being too modest – I had the pleasure of creeping under your dark cloth a couple of times and can sincerely say that you do have an eye for a good photo. Which leads me to your point: I don’t entirely agree that good photographers are born with seeing eyes. I know from my experience that as I got better I began to see more. However, the improvement accelerated under the guidance and stimulation of good tour leaders and sneaking a look at what more experienced and/or gifted participants were doing. I have definitely become more receptive to what’s in front of me. Well, at least I think I have. The result is I shoot far less film than I used to but I am much more pleased with the results. Of course I have lots to learn, especially about how to convey my emotions on to film, but that’s the challenge and the fun.</p>

<dd><p>If the image in it's purest state is the fundamental 'hind brain' language then we have developed grammar and art through our understanding of how that language works. <BR/><BR/>An intellectual tome can be rewarding but so can a poem. Both communicate meaning but the poem leaves mystery and uses a shared understanding of the world to suggest a message. The viewer has to be receptive, but not necessarily erudite, to be swayed toward the intended meaning.  <BR/><BR/>I put it that some of David's images are visual Haiku.<BR/><BR/>For an image to really work, the artist must not only know the language and grammar but also empathise and relate to the viewer to be able to hint at meaning rather than to just inform.<BR/><BR/>My personal photographic creations are still happily grunting I'm afraid... :-) <BR/><BR/>I think it's a little simplistic to say that there are just photographer's photographs and then there are laymen's photographs. These are just two categories of many that can overlap, and when they do overlap it can be a wondrous thing.</p>

<div id="cpost-body" style="display:none;"><div class="post"><div class="post-body">[Photo]A Photographer's Photograph?<br/><br/>I received a very interesting email from Oceans reader Adam musing on whether there are two classes of photograph; layman's photographs and photographer's photographs. Here (with his permission!) is his text in full for you to ponder on...<br/><br/>A few months ago a friend was looking at some of my photos and said of a fairly straightforward shot from Red Canyon (Utah) that it was a photographer’s photograph. I asked him to explain, and he said something about the way trees were placed around the image, the restricted colour palette (just green and hues of red) and lack of horizon (the sky was desperately bland that morning). I forgot about that conversation until recently, when as part of a discussion about photo clubs, someone else I know said that he would wish to avoid the “dreary photographer’s photography …. I'll lose the visual immediacy  ….”.  And this time I started thinking a bit more. What is it that makes an image arresting to the general viewer yet also evokes admiration from those who know about photography? <br/> <br/>Let’s take the case of a wonderful landscape in dramatic light: as long as we can set up the tripod and point the camera in the right direction, then we will get a satisfactory image whether we use a simple digicam or LF big gun. It’s point and shoot, period. For this exercise I will ignore the problems of balancing out a dark foreground with bright sky etc.<br/> <br/>But the enthusiast photographer could perhaps take a bit more care, think about using some elements of the foreground more effectively to strengthen the composition and add more impact. Perhaps using a rock the shape of which echoed that of a distant mountain. Here the photographer hopes to reproduce his own vision and uses some specialist equipment – a wide angle lens and a low viewpoint, or perhaps an LF camera with movements. By injecting his own vision, is he being creative and therefore moving towards being artistic? Well, I think yes if the resulting image is clearly more effective than that first point-&amp;-shoot of what the photographer first saw.<br/> <br/>As long as the image follows the conventionally accepted “rules” of composition, is sharp and well exposed, then the p&amp;s as well as the more impactful image should get good marks from a photo club judge – and hopefully the second image will get a point or two more.<br/> <br/>But let’s consider the case of pealing paint on a Tuscan door (forgive me DW!)  where the subtle colours and textures contrast with the straight lines of the door structure. It’s a technical shot in that it would be difficult if not impossible to get the same image using cameras lacking the movements of LF. The rules of composition are probably irrelevant, the colours muted, the exposure spot on; what could or should a judge make of that? And what could an uninitiated viewer make of it? Unless the photographer manages to convey a sense of the feeling or emotion he experienced when he saw that door, the image will fail: better days gone by, current dereliction, abandonment, someone’s handiwork going to ruin…. Otherwise, it’s just a shot of a door, a so-called record shot and will be judged on that basis. Many non-photographers might just walk on by to the next print on the wall.<br/> <br/>Or what about an abstraction from nature, perhaps detail from some colourful tree bark or contrasting colours of lichen and rock. Again the composition will probably not follow the conventional rules, and might leave the viewer to wander around the image noticing little details here and there. Some effort may be necessary and go beyond the "wow" of colours and textures to realise what the image is. Here David’s Detail at Poverty Flats in Utah is a wonderful example.<br/> <br/>Are these last two photographer’s photographs? Possibly, but they are not necessarily dreary (certainly not the Detail). Conversely, I have seen some wonderful strong images full of passion being panned by judges for being composed not quite on the rule of thirds, or with the exposure “too dark” despite thereby separating the main subject from its background. Here the judge was seemingly looking precisely for conventional photographer’s photographs and didn't know how to react to something different. And it is that tendency to judge an image against a set of "rules" which strangles original photographic interpretation of the beauty around us.<br/><br/>So, what do I feel?<br/><br/>It's obvious that the interpretation of any image is dependent upon the level of sophistication of the viewer. An expert in Renaissance Art would certainly have a richer experience when viewing the Mona Lisa than the mythical man in the street would. The important question is should I, as a photographer aspiring to art rather than illustration, be worried that some people don't 'get' my images. I think the answer has to be a resounding "No!" This doesn't mean that I'm being elitist. I feel that my images are accessible on a number of different levels. Some viewers will only appreciate the colours or form, some think about the relationship of negative to positive space, some see references to other forms of art, some be lost in what the image evokes for them, some all of the above and more. It doesn't matter whether a viewer accesses the image on one, two or all available levels. It doesn't ultimately matter if an individual viewer isn't moved by a particular image. Neither Picasso nor van Gogh nor Monet nor Turner nor Whistler nor Mondrian nor Pollock were exactly populist for large parts of their carreers. Yet now their works are accepted as important milestones in the history of art. Popularity alone has never been a sign of quality. What would matter was if no one other than the photographer was moved by the images that they made.<br/><br/>I certainly don't worry that camera club judges might mark me down for not using the "rule of thirds" (this is a merely a degenerate bastardisation of the more subtle Golden Section and the fact that they probably don't know this only shows up their ignorance). Art isn't about formulas, it's not something that should be constrained by rules in this way. That doesn't mean that certain approaches aren't better than others, they obviously are. It just means that the whole exercise is more subtle and rich than any rule might suggest. Of course the real reason that judges apply rules is so that there can be some standards for comparison.  And here's the fundamental flaw in the whole exercise. The appreciation of any work of art must necessarily be relative not absolute. One man's 10/10 is another's 2/10. The range of possible connotations in any image are too wide and subtle. Trying to constrain the possibilities for solving the three dimensional puzzle of composition by constraining the outcome using rules is a denial of the existence of these subtle signs. It shows a paucity of vision. There cannot be a consistent system for making an absolute comparison between one image and another. Period.<br/><br/>Are there photographer's photographs? Absolutely! If there weren't it would show that no one had really explored the possibilities for the medium beyond bland illustration, beyond the postcard.  I feel that the image at the top of this post might well fall into the category of photographer's photograph. The only downside that I can see is that these images are probably less commercial than ones that are more straightforward.</div>
