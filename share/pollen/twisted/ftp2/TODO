FTP Resources

locateChild and then work on that resource, i.e. size, mtime, etc.


Current Directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Might need to send the new directory back in the response string.

    OR
    
The protocol might need to keep track of the path, probably as a sequence of
strings, and construct a full path each time it is passed to the FTPShell. That
means that changeDirectory should either silently succeed or raise an error.

Try this with Mozilla:

    * ftp://matt@localhost:8021/
    * Change to a directory (make sure it's refreshed)
    * Refresh again.
    
For some reason Moz sends a relative cwd.
